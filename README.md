# Backup cleaning ðŸ§¹
### Purpose of the application
The **Backup cleaning** allows to purge folders of backups in a server. The parameters of time (in days), locations and logs configurations can be set through a file named settings.json.

The settings.json file uses some examples to config:
- First configurations is about the time that the application should run again. This time is set in seconds.
- Log folder and name, you can choose the best name and location for that.
- Days to count before the current computer date to purge folders and its files.
- Root path that the application needs to look for subfolders with data modifications under the date of purge. You can define the value for that if today is 2024/05/20 and you set the value as 15, the application will delete only folders that was modificated under or equal 2024/05/04.

### Required dependences
You can run this application in a **Linux** server with **Python 3.6** installed
- You just need to run the command: python ./backup-cleaning.py

Or if your server uses a Windows operational system you can do that compiling the application using the following steps.
- Install in your computer the **Python 3.6**
- Install the PyInstaller (pip install pyinstaller)
- Download these project files on your computer
- Open the project folder in the same terminal
- **Type the command**: pyinstaller --onefile .\backup-cleaning.py
- Copy the file backup-cleaning.exe saved from the **dist** folder on a folder on the target computer.
- Also copy the settings.json to the same folder on the target computer.
- You can create a service using NSSM application, or a task on the Windows or just run the backup-cleaning.exe

### How to run tests?
For varius tests you can use another application of mine called [FoldersCreatorForTests](https://github.com/EssiasSouza/FoldersCreatorForTests").
FoldersCreatorForTests creates folders and files by changing the modification date, which allows you to test various backup file scenarios.

### Used technologies
The **Backup-Cleaning** was created only in python using some libraries:
- datetime (To work the data modification time information)
- time (To allow tests and wait states)
- os (To access OS directories)
- shutil (To manage OS directories)
- lib_applogs (Also created by me to configure the logs files when I create any applications)
- json

### How to run the application
To run the application you need to follow the **Required dependences**.
**For Linux you run**:
- python./backup-cleaning.py
**For Windows you can only run the same command or:**
- Compile the application
- Run backup-cleaning.exe

### Possibles problems / Faced problems
I faced no problems in building this, you just need to be awake to the time of purging and the true path you need to purge.

### Next steps
Implement the purging of logs generated by the application and copying the logs for sending via EDI.
